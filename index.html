            The year 2021 promises to be a make or break year when it comes to delivering on the policy<br> agenda agreed in 2015. Without real action on climate in the next ten years, extreme weather<br> events will be overwhelming, especially for developing countries. 
        <br><br>
        Disasters impact low- and middle-income countries disproportionately, particularly in terms of<br> mortality, numbers of people injured, displaced and homeless, economic losses (as a<br> percentage of GDP) and damage to critical infrastructure. We cannot eradicate poverty and<br>hunger if we don’t step up investments in disaster risk reduction. International cooperation for<br> developing countries through Official Development Aid (ODA) and capacity building is <br>essential to boost disaster resilience in the face of extreme weather events and other natural <br>and man-made hazards.

   <div class="cont">
    The <b>International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction</b> was started in <b>1989</b>, after a call by the United Nations General Assembly for a day to promote a global culture of risk-awareness and disaster reduction. Held every <b>13 October</b>, the day celebrates how people and communities around the world are reducing their exposure to disasters and raising awareness about the importance of reining in the risks that they face.<br><br>
    In <b>2015</b> at the <b>Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction</b> in <b>Sendai, Japan</b>, the international community was reminded that disasters hit hardest at the local level with the potential to cause loss of life and great social and economic upheaval. Sudden onset disasters displace millions of people every year. Disasters, many of which are exacerbated by climate change, have a negative impact on investment in sustainable development and the desired outcomes.
    <br><br>
    It is also at the local level that capacities need to be strengthened urgently. The <b>Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction</b> is people-focussed and action-oriented in its approach to disaster risk reduction and applies to the risk of small-scale and large-scale disasters caused by man-made, or natural hazards, as well as related environmental, technological and biological hazards and risks.

   <div class="mitigate">Disaster Mitigation</div>
   <div class="conte"><b>Disaster Mitigation is the cornerstone of emergency management</b>. It’s the ongoing effort to lessen the impact disasters have on people and property. Mitigation involves keeping homes away from floodplains, engineering bridges to withstand earthquakes, creating and enforcing effective building codes to protect property from hurricanes, and more.<br><br>
    Mitigation is defined as <b>“sustained action that reduces or eliminates long-term risk to people and property from natural hazards and their effects.”</b> It describes the ongoing effort at the federal, state, local and individual levels to lessen the impact of disasters upon our families, homes, communities and economy.

<div class="mitigate">How Disaster Mitigation Can Help You</div>
<div class="conte">
    In practice, mitigation can take many forms. It can involve actions such as:
<ul>
<li>Promoting sound land use planning based on known hazards</li>

<li>Relocating or elevating structures out of the floodplains</li>
<li>Securing shelves and water heaters to nearby walls.</li>
<li>Having hurricane straps installed to more securely attach a structure’s roof to its walls and foundation.</li>
<li>Developing, adopting, and enforcing effective building codes and standards</li>
<li>Engineering roads and bridges to withstand earthquakes</li>
<li>Using fire-retardant materials in new construction</li>
<li>Developing and implementing a plan in your business or community to reduce your susceptibility to hazards</li>
</ul>
